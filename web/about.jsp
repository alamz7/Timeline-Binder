        To watch a whole video just because one is interested in a few seconds segment results in
        wastage of time and energy. Imagine someone is looking for a topic or issue of his interest. 
        One would go through different videos one by one and would manually adjust timeline
        of each video according to one's need. Ideally, one would wish to see segments of interest at a single place instead of being scattered across
        different videos, thus, making it possible to watch a single video of full interest rather than 9, 10
        videos of partial interest which would end up saving time and energy.

        <span style="font-style: italic">Timeline Binder </span>attempts to combine related segments across different online videos into a single
        timeline. Based on users query tags, <span style="font-style: italic">Timeline Binder </span> selects all videos
        containing those tags as captions in a specific domain. Consequently, segments matching captions
        are extracted and added into a single timeline thus making a single video of interest.
